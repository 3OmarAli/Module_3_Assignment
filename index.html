				<p>The food we eat plays a vital role in how we look and feel. Regular exercise is important but according to research, nutrition has the largest impact on our fitness.1﻿ Using food as our medicine has become a popular theme for health improvement.

				The trend is now to focus on healthy food intake as a primary fitness goal. When healthy eating habits become a lifestyle, we are healthier and happier. ​Eating right allows us to reduce body fat, lose a few pounds, feel more confident and reduce our risk of illness. 

				Frequent studies are indicating healthy food intake as the most important part of our fitness programs. Some physicians are teaching healthy eating habits and lifestyles as a way to improve overall health by reducing obesity and related disease. <div class="text-center"><a href="#ourmenu"><strong>Back to Top</strong></a></div> </p>

				<p>Exercise and physical activity are great ways to feel better, boost your health and have fun. For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends:

				At least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. The guidelines suggest that you spread this exercise throughout the week. Examples include running, walking or swimming. Even small amounts of physical activity are helpful, and accumulated activity throughout the day adds up to provide health benefits.

				Strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two times a week. Examples include lifting free weights, using weight machines or body-weight.  <div class="text-center"><a href="#ourmenu"><strong>Back to Top</strong></a></div> </p>

				<p>Sleep gives your body time to recover, conserve energy, and repair and build up the muscles worked during exercise. When we get enough good quality sleep, the body produces growth hormone. During childhood and adolescence, growth hormone makes us grow (as the name implies, Winter says. “And when we are older, it helps us build lean muscle and helps our body repair when we have torn ourselves up during a hard workout,” he adds. “Growth hormone is essential for athletic recovery.The problem is a major issue when it comes to sleep: More than 30 percent of us are sleep-deprived, which means we're not getting the recommended seven to eight hours a night required for adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
